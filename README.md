# Finance-Variance-Analysis-AI-Agent
I recently built a no-code AI workflow for finance that automates a full variance analysis from raw data to decision-ready commentary.
The logic is simple:

Trigger → data update
Transform → clean, reconcile, analyze
Notify → deliver insights where teams actually work

What the workflow does:
Pulls finance data automatically
Cleans and reconciles it with audit-friendly controls
Runs variance analysis
Generates AI-based commentary
Adds a human approval step
Sends the final output via email or Slack

No scripts. No heavy infrastructure. Just repeatable finance logic.

The key takeaway for me:
 AI in finance is not about replacing judgment.
 It’s about removing friction before judgment is applied.
